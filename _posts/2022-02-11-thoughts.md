 Interpretations Of The ResNet Architecture
* A ResNet architecture is an iterative soft thresholidng algorithm that is unfolded.
* Look into [LISTA](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/publis/pdf/gregor-icml-10.pdf)
* Soft Thresholding is a crude approximation to a solution for the Basis Pursuit problem.

Sparse Coding
* Sparse coding algorithms project a high dimensional signal into a low dimensional subspace. This kills a lot of needless noise in the process.
  * That being said, you could train a deep network and observe non-sparsity. It is unclear whether sparsity is a necessary condition for good performance.
  * At the same time, it seems to be the case that the sparser your matrices are, the more likely you are to recover features/the right class. There has been emperical work on the single-layer model that shows this trend.
